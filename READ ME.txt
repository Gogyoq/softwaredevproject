Description: A personality quiz that assigns you one of twelve goats at the end
Prerequesites: pygame


DISCLAIMER REGARDING GOAT VIDEO SOUND:
Some goat videos have sound turned off by default since the original audio is not good or includes people talking. 
We did this to maintain a feeling of polish to our program.
The goat videos that have sound by default require/benefit greatly from having audio.
If you would like all goat videos to have sound please change the soundsON boolean to True.
The variable is located right under our imports and pygame.init()

The goat videos affected by the soundsON variable are:
Happy Goat, Gamer Goat, Healthy Goat, Spider Goat, Army Goat and Boxer Goat
